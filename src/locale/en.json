			"We are a <strong>network of volunteer</strong> godparents from different countries of the world who <strong>collaborate with rural schools</strong> in Uruguay.",
			"Godparents have different personal and work paths: educators, scientists, social scientists, pilots, entrepreneurs, journalists, filmmakers, graduate students, etc. Some are retired, others are active, we all share the spirit of solidarity and commitment to work with children and their teachers.",
			"The tutors are teachers of English as a foreign language from various backgrounds who know the context in which the Godparents Project is developed."

		"secondParagraphs": [
			"In 2018 Inglés Sin Límites’ program started bringing English instruction to rural schools where neither face to face English teachers nor remote videoconference lessons are available because of both geographical location and/or weak internet connection.",
			"In 2019 during some meetings, teachers mentioned the challenging situation regarding the use of the target language when implementing Inglés Sin Límites in their schools. Teachers also showed themselves open and predisposed to learning the foreign language.",
			"Other volunteering experiences of retired English teachers took place in a few rural schools.",
			"During the second semester of 2019 a Godparents’ pilot Project was implemented in 25 rural schools with positive results, after which the project extended to 250 schools in 2020.",
			"Today, 550 schools are participating in the Godparents’ project with 500 godparents as active members.",
			"<i>Inglés Sin Límites </i>(ISL) is rooted in two different aspects of the teacher’s role:",
			"<ol><li>Organization and learning facilitation.</li><li>Lack of expertise in the target language.</li></ol>",
			"Despite not having a deep understanding of English language to be taught, rural teachers’ training regarding classroom management and learning processes, planning and organization in other contents of the national curriculum gives them tools and strategies to implement Inglés Sin Límites in their schools.",
			"The program is delivered through video-lessons where language functions, exponents and vocabulary are presented. A guided lesson plan is provided to the school teacher with detailed information about classroom management and specific English teaching strategies.",
			"In four years of implementation, Inglés Sin Límites has shown that children from rural schools learn a foreign language with <strong> professional, active and motivated teachers.</strong>"
